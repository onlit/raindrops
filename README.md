## Overview

Raindrops is a game. It is simple and direct. Raindrops fall. They carry equations. Your task is to solve them before they touch the ground. It is not merely a game, but a test of speed and knowledge.

## Features

- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The game begins simply. As time passes, it demands more. The equations grow harder. (planned for future)
- **Interactive Gameplay**: You enter answers. Correct ones score points. Incorrect ones teach lessons.
- **Pause and Resume**: Life intervenes. Pause the game. Resume when ready. The game waits. (partially done)
